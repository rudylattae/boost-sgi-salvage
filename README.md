BOOST! SGI Salvage
===================

I like checking out the SGI Salvage website a lot. Sometimes I feel it is a bit unwieldy to navigate. I don't have 
access to the source so I cannot improve it from the server side. This is my attempt to streamline the user experience 
on the client side (in the browser).
